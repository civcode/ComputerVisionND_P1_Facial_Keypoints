    "Each CNN has at least one convolutional layer that is composed of stacked filters (also known as convolutional kernels). As a CNN trains, it learns what weights to include in its convolutional kernels and when these kernels are applied to some input image, they produce a set of **feature maps**. So, feature maps are just sets of filtered images; they are the images produced by applying a convolutional kernel to an input image. These maps show us the features that the different layers of the neural network learn to extract. For example, you might imagine a convolutional kernel that detects the vertical edges of a face or another one that detects the corners of eyes. You can see what kind of features each of these kernels detects by applying them to an image. One such example is shown below; from the way it brings out the lines in an the image, you might characterize this as an edge detection filter.\n",
